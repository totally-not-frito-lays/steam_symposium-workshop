# Plan.md

## Who am I?

- I'm Ryan, I'm a STEM instructor at Monarch
  - 2 summer camps
  - 2 robotics classes
  - 1 creative coding class
- I also
  - coach hackathons
  - develop cultural-coding family workshops

## What type of workshop is this?

- Teach by example
  - I'll walk through one of our lesson plans
  - We'll do a meta analysis of what we're accomplishing
- You get to build a robot AND see the teaching framework in action

### Topics we'll cover today

- how capstone events can bridge the language barrier
- governance and engagement
- mental models

### Agenda

- creating a shared vocabulary
  - guiding artifacts
  - tutorial method
  - mental models
- capstone event examples
  - echo-location unplugged activity
  - soccer competition
  - race
  - catapult competition
- traits of a good competition
  - well-defined practice area
  - mental model that everybody is familiar with
  - social bonding experience
- governance and learning
  - hats and roles

### No need to take notes!

This whiteboard and all the resources in it will be available to you via the
qr code.

## Today's Project

- 1/3 questions:
  - what do birds, racoons, crabs, and humans have in common?
    - opposable thumbs (kinda)
- Pick one to watch
  - crab rave
  - the claw (toy story)
- Define a claw / hand / grabber
  - something that can grab by opening and closing
- Goal
  - build a claw / hand to shake hands OR pick something up
  - two ways to close
    - button
    - sensor

> meta things
> - governance is a psychogically safe way to be involved
> - voting for something visual is easy to do as ELL
> - shared vocabulary
> - guiding artifact, everybody is on the same page
> - establish a mental model that you can reference
> - alternative goals presented with the same mechanic

### Demo opening and closing

- buttons
- sensors

## Bonus topics

- hats, roles, and how to use them
  - learners really like responsibility that makes them different from the others
- sharing is a learned skill
  - facilitate sharing by offering up roles dedicated to different sub-tasks
    - ie. programming-pro, motor-mayor, builder-boss
- learners remember events more than what they built
- capstone events are social experiences
